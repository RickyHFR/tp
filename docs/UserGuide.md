## Quick start

> Note:
> - "Home folder" refers to the main folder where your FinClient files are stored.
> - "cd into" means opening your command terminal and typing "cd" followed by a space and the folder path (e.g., cd /Users/yourname/Documents). Then press Enter to change the current directory.
> - "GUI" (Graphical User Interface) is the windowed application that you interact with using your mouse and keyboard.

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

3. Find the file (called `finclient.jar`) and move it into the folder where you want your FinClient app to store data.

4. Open a command window (also known as `Terminal` on MacOS or `Command Prompt` on Windows).
   1. On Windows: Press the Windows key, type cmd, and press Enter.
   2. On Mac: Open Terminal from the Applications > Utilities folder.

5. In the command window, go to the folder where you saved the file. You do this by typing cd followed by the folder path.

    For example:
   ```
   cd Downloads/FinClient
   ```

6. Now, start the app by typing this and pressing Enter:
   ```
   java -jar finclient.jar
   ```

   After a few seconds, a window should pop up that looks like the one below. It comes with some sample data already filled in, so you can start exploring right away.

</figure>

7. Type the command in the command box (at the top of the window) and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window. Some example commands you can try (you can refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command):

   * `list` : List all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Add a contact named `John Doe` to FinClient.

   * `delete 3` : Delete the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the arguments to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an argument which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items that are in square brackets are optional, and those without square brackets are mandatory. <br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `…` can be repeated any number of times (including not at all).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` `(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, or `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Arguments can be in any order <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous arguments for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If you are referring to a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a scrollable message containing current available commands and provides a description on how to get more help.

Format: `help`

<figure>
  <img src="images/help_message.png" alt="result for 'help'" width="600px">
  <figcaption align="center"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Help Message.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Adding a person : `add`

Adds a person to FinClient.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [p/PHONE_NUMBER]… e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/REMARK [by/TIME]] [t/TAG]…​ [c/COMPANY] [j/job] [s/STOCKPLATFORM] [$/NETWORTH]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)<br>
:bulb: **Tip:**
Optional fields can be left out when adding a person's contact.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
Duplicate persons are not allowed. If you try to add a person with the same name and phone numbers as an existing person, FinClient will ignore the new entry and display a message indicating that the person already exists.<br>
</div>

Now, suppose you want to add the contact of Betsy Crowe, who is your friend. In that case, your command includes her name (`n/Betsy Crowe`), a tag indicating "friend" (`t/friend`), her email (`betsycrowe@example.com`), address (`Newgate Prison`), and phone number (`p/1234567`) along with optional remarks (`r/10 year sentence t/criminal`).

Example input:
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 r/10 year sentence t/criminal `

Now, suppose you want to add the contact of Sherlock Holmes, a family member. You include his name (`n/Sherlock Holmes`), a "family" tag, his email, phone number, and address. You also add a remark (`r/family dinner`) and schedule it with a timestamp using `by/2025-04-03 18:00`, indicating when the event will happen.

Example input:
* `add n/Sherlock Holmes t/family e/sherlock@example.com a/221B Baker Street p/1234567 r/family dinner by/2025-04-03 18:00 t/detective `

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in FinClient.

Format: `list`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**
`list` is handy in these cases:
* **Resetting after a filtered view:** If you have just used the [`find`](#locating-persons-by-tag) command (or any other command) that shows a _subset_ of your contacts, `list` will bring back the _full set_ of all contacts.
* **Verifying updates:** After adding, editing, or removing multiple persons, running `list` ensures that any unexpected filters or sorting are cleared, so you see the entire, up-to-date list at once.
* **Navigating from another feature:** In some (proposed) workflows, you might be reviewing transaction records or other data. Using `list` ensures you return to the complete contact view without any lingering search results or partial views.
</div>


### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in FinClient.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK [by/TIME]] [t/TAG]…​ [c/COMPANY] [j/job] [s/STOCKPLATFORM] [$/NETWORTH]`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Similarly, you can remove the person's remark field by typing `r/` with no description or timestamp.
* However, empty remarks with timestamp such as `r/ by/2025-03-30 16:00` are not accepted.
* For the optional fields of company, job, stock platform and networth, you can remove the existing value by typing their prefix followed with `delete`.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit 1 r/scheduled meeting by/2025-04-03 10:00` Edits the remark of the 1st person to be `scheduled meeting` and associates it with the timestamp `2025-04-03 10:00`, indicating the scheduled time of the event.
*  `edit 1 r/` removes the remark field of the 1st person.
*  `edit 2 j/delete c/LittleStartUp s/delete $/delete` Edits the company of the 2nd person to be `LittleStartUp` and clears the existing job, stock platform and networth.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Tag, Company, Job, Stock Platform and Networth are all optional. You can delete these optional fields too!
</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
To add deadlines to remarks, the by/ argument must be supplied right after r/.

The edit command requires `r/REMARKS by/TIME` if you wish to add a deadline. `by/TIME r/REMARKS` is not acceptable. Similarly, there should not any other arguments between these two.
</div>

### Locating persons by name : `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
* Use `list` to see all contacts again.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`.<br>

<figure>
  <img src="images/find_alex_david.png" alt="result for 'find alex david'" width="600px">

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FinClient will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id="known-issues">Known issues</span>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If you use the shortcuts provided to access help or exit the application**, note that some devices differ in what to press for the shortcut. For example, to access help, you may need to press `Fn + F1` or just `F1` depending on your device settings. The remedy is to check which of the two, `Fn + F1` or `F1`, works for you to open help, and which of the two, `Fn + F2` of `F2` works for you to exit the application.
